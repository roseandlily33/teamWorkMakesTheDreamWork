# Team Work Makes The Dream Work:
Week #12 Challenge

## Description:
A content management system (CMS) the allows easy access to information that is stored in databases. Using node.js, inquirer, console.table, and MySQL. On running node index it presents you with a list of options that you can select, from updating the employees role, to seeing each table to adding an employee, role or department.

## Sucesses:
I had a lot of successes with the project I found MySQL to be very fun to work with after getting the hang of the syntax and exactly what was going on and how to do it. I had a lot of success with even thinking of how to organize it and what needed to be seperated into what file that I thought would make sense, you could also do it by the category as well - putting all the department functions in one, etc. But I found that the way I did it made it easier to work with import, where things were going wrong, what worked for one was easy to translate it to the next function etc. I also had a dillema that I figured out which was how to add the department when that was added to list and so I made an array with the dept names, and pushed it to the new array.

## What I Learned:
What I learned was how to use MySQL, I really enjoyed working with it. I also got a deeper understanding on how to seperate the files and what packages etc are needed for each one like db or inquirer.
