# Team Work Makes The Dream Work:
Week #12 Challenge

## Description:
A content management system (CMS) the allows easy access to information that is stored in databases. Using node.js, inquirer, console.table, and MySQL. On running node index it presents you with a list of options that you can select, from updating the employees role, to seeing each table to adding an employee, role or department.

## Usage:
Clone the project, run npm install, run node index, in a seperate terminal, cd into the db, run mysql and login, run source schema.sql, and source seeds.sql, and select from the list what action you would like to follow and follow the prompts. 

## Sucesses:
I had a lot of successes with the project I found MySQL to be very fun to work with after getting the hang of the syntax and exactly what was going on and how to do it. I had a lot of success with even thinking of how to organize it and what needed to be seperated into what file that I thought would make sense, you could also do it by the category as well - putting all the department functions in one, etc. But I found that the way I did it made it easier to work with import, where things were going wrong, what worked for one was easy to translate it to the next function etc. I also used prettier with this project to make the code look nicer, I found with this project especailly (my code doesn't get that messy usually) this came in really useful.

## Difficulties
A difficulty I had with this project was displaying the information that was already in the SQL database. Also the biggest difficulty was learning to work with the primary keys, and instead of showing the primary key value getting the name value and mapping through that to get the other one, then I had some that needed that done for 2, and the way I was doing it for 1 didn't work and jumped over it, then I got some help and with the things that we have be learning this week with await, async, try and catch I was able to implement some of that (with some help) but I love how that one looks compared to the other ones, it makes it so much easier and nicer looking. 

## What I Learned:
 Truly this was one of the hardest challenges for me to date, but I learned so much through it like to how use MySQL, which I really liked, also using the map method is something that I felt like I wasn't very familiar with and am much more comfortable now and got a deeper understanding on how to sepearte the files and what packages should go inside of each file. As well as using the await/async, try/catch.
